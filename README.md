# Arthropods_Brazil
R script for data analysis of arthropod community data collected in an iron mine in Brazil (Lyngaard et al)

Here you will find the files used for data analyses. The files are named based on the season and the primer, as follows:
BDL -> Data from dry season and DNA amplified with the Leray primer
BDZ -> Data from dry season and DNA amplified with the Zeale primer
BRL -> Data from rainy season and DNA amplified with the Leray primer
BRZ -> Data from rainy season and DNA amplified with the Zeale primer

If using the Rscript, please remember to use the different _OTU_env.txt files, depending on the season and primers of interest.
